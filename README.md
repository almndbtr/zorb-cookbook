# Almond's Zorb Cookbook

 👋 Hello, I'm `@almndbtr`. I created Almond's Zorb Cookbook because I'm interested in learning [Svelte & Vercel](https://vercel.com/guides/deploying-svelte-with-vercel) and stretching myself creatively by finding interesting ways to use the [Zorb Web Component](https://github.com/ourzora/zorb/tree/main/packages/zorb-web-component).

## Dedication

- 💐 To my partner, who encourages me to be creative every day.
- 🌜🌞🌛 To the `@ourzora` engineering team for creating [`zorb`](https://zorb.dev`). One of my life goals is to collaborate with ya’ll on something awesome. Thanks for building the incredible [zora.co](https://zora.co) and being delightful open source maintainers.
